## Motivation

In many robotics and autonomous systems scenarios, data such as point clouds and high-resolution images must be transmitted from resource-limited edge devices (e.g., embedded robots, drones) to more capable ground or cloud nodes for processing and visualization. However, bandwidth, latency, and power constraints make raw data transmission impractical.  
This project addresses this challenge by providing:

- Real-time compression on the edge device  
- Lightweight transmission of compressed data  
- Decompression and visualization on the cloud or ground station  
- Seamless bridging between ROS 1/ROS 2 environments  

---

## Features

- Supports both ROS 1 and ROS 2 message types and custom compression messages  
- Modular design: easily swap compression/decompression algorithms  
- Shell scripts to build all components, onboard modules, and ground station modules  
- ROS launch files for easy startup of compression/decompression pipelines  
- Example usage for point cloud and image compression

## Architecture

```

[ Edge Device (ROS 1) ] â†’ Compression Module â†’ Transmit â†’ Decompression Module â†’ [ Ground Station (ROS 2) ]

````

- **Edge Device**: Runs the compression module (e.g., DRACO, JPEG XL) to encode data  
- **Transmission**: The compressed data is sent over the network  
- **Ground Station**: Receives compressed data, decompresses it, and feeds into ROS pipelines for further processing/visualization  
- **Custom ROS Messages** (`custom_compression_msgs`) are used for encoded payloads and control  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ROS 1 (e.g., Melodic, Noetic) and/or ROS 2 (e.g., Foxy, Humble)  
- CMake, Python, and build tools  
- Required compression libraries (e.g., DRACO, JPEG XL)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eki-Shalll/ros_edge_compression_bridge.git
   cd ros_edge_compression_bridge
````

2. Initialize submodules (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

### Build Instructions

* To build **all** components:

  ```bash
  ./build_all.sh
  ```

* To build **onboard (edge)** modules only:

  ```bash
  ./build_onboard.sh
  ```

* To build **ground station (cloud/high-perf)** modules only:

  ```bash
  ./build_ground_station.sh
  ```

---

## Usage

### Onboard (Edge) Setup

1. Launch the compression node (ROS 1):

   ```bash
   ./launch_compress-ros.sh
   ```
2. Ensure your sensor publisher (e.g., point cloud, camera image) is active.
   The compression node will subscribe and publish compressed messages.

### Ground Station (Cloud/High-Perf) Setup

1. Launch the decompression/visualization node (ROS 2):

   ```bash
   ./launch_onboard.sh
   ./launch_ground_station.sh
   ```
2. The decompressed data will be available in ROS 2 topics for further processing or display.

---

## Supported Compression Modules

* **DRACO** â€“ for point cloud compression
* **JPEG XL** â€“ for image compression
* Additional modules can be added under:

  * `jxl_compress_ros1_ws`
  * `jxl_decompress_ros2_ws`
  * `draco`
  * or other custom workspaces

---

## Customization & Extension

You can extend the compression framework by adding your own encoding/decoding module:

1. Add the algorithm under a new workspace (e.g., `my_compress_ws`)
2. Define ROS message types under `custom_msgs_ros1_ws` or `custom_msgs_ros2_ws`
3. Modify the bridge node to integrate new modules

Parameters such as topics, compression quality, and network endpoints can be configured via ROS parameters or launch files.
